# Lesson 1
## Introduction to Python (seminars)
### Homework:


1. Write a program that accepts a digit indicating the day of the week as input and checks whether this day is a weekend.
<br/>
Example:
<br/> 
    6 &#8594; yes <br/>
    7 &#8594; yes <br/>
    1 &#8594; no <br/>
<br/>
2. Write a program for verification of the truth of the statemen ¬(X ⋁ Y ⋁ Z) = ¬X ⋀ ¬Y ⋀ ¬Z for all values of the predicate.
<br/>
<br/>
3. Write a program that takes the coordinates of a point (X and Y) as input, with X ≠ 0 and Y ≠ 0 and outputs the number of the quarter of the plane in which this point is located (or on which axis it is located).
<br/>
Example:
<br/>
    x=34; y=-30 &#8594; 4 <br/>
    x=2; y=4 &#8594; 1 <br/>
    x=-34; y=-30 &#8594; 3 <br/>
<br/>
4. Write a program that shows the range of possible coordinates of points in this quarter (x and y) according to the given number of quarters.
<br/>
<br/>
5. Write a program that takes the coordinates of two points as input and finds the distance between them in 2D space.
<br/>
Example:
<br/>
    A (3,6); B (2,1) &#8594; 5,09 <br/>
    A (7,-5); B (1,-1) &#8594; 7,21 <br/>
